You're a senior front-end developer. I need you to clean up and update the codebase of the website www.crumbhaven.in, keeping the **design, photos, fonts, and overall layout exactly the same**. Follow the exact instructions below:

---

‚úÖ 1. REMOVE DUPLICATES:
- Remove repeated "Explore Our Treats" or any duplicate product showcase sections.
- Eliminate unnecessary or repeated text blocks, banners, or CTAs.

‚úÖ 2. FIX MISSING TESTIMONIALS:
- Add a **Testimonials** section with this structure:
  <section id="testimonials">
    <h2>What Our Fans Say</h2>
    <div class="testimonial">‚ÄúFinally, cookies that taste sinful but feel guilt-free!‚Äù ‚Äì Radhika S.</div>
    <div class="testimonial">‚ÄúThe Kodo Millet cookie is a revolution!‚Äù ‚Äì Arjun M.</div>
  </section>
- Style the testimonials in a clean grid or slider layout. Match Crumb Haven‚Äôs soft brand theme (beige, brown, pink).

‚úÖ 3. ENSURE PRODUCTS SECTION IS VISIBLE:
- If the product section is hidden or not loading, fix display issues.
- Ensure this section shows: Product images + name + short description + "Order Now" CTA.

‚úÖ 4. FIX NAVIGATION ANCHORS:
- Ensure top navigation links correctly scroll to:
  - Home (`#home`)
  - About Us (`#about`)
  - Products (`#products`)
  - Testimonials (`#testimonials`)
  - Contact (`#contact`)
- Use smooth scroll behavior.

‚úÖ 5. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- Make sure all sections (especially Testimonials and Products) render correctly on mobile and tablet.
- Fix any overlapping, overflow, or scaling issues using CSS media queries.

‚úÖ 6. CLEAN CODE:
- Remove unused `<div>`, `<style>`, or `<script>` blocks.
- Remove any commented-out HTML or leftover placeholders.
- Add `alt` attributes to all `<img>` tags.
- Keep the file structure clean and organized (HTML in `index.html`, styles in `style.css`, and scripts in `script.js`).

---

‚õî Do NOT:
- Change the site‚Äôs visual theme
- Replace images or brand colors
- Modify text outside the duplicated sections

üéØ Final Output:
A cleaned-up, fully functional Crumb Haven site with no duplication, visible testimonials, working product showcase, and perfect mobile responsiveness.
