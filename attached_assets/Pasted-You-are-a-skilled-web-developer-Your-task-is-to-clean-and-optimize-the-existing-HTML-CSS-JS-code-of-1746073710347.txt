You are a skilled web developer. Your task is to clean and optimize the existing HTML/CSS/JS code of the website www.crumbhaven.in. Do not redesign the website or change its existing photos, layout, or colors. Only correct the following:

1. ‚úÖ **Remove Content Duplication:**
   - The homepage has multiple repeated blocks of content. Identify and remove any *redundant sections*, especially those that repeat the intro paragraph, CTAs, or banner content.
   - Ensure no section appears more than once unless it‚Äôs meant to be reused (like navbars or footers).

2. ‚úÖ **Fix Missing Sections:**
   - The **Testimonials** section is not visible on the live site. Ensure it is included and properly styled. Add `id="testimonials"` to help navigation and enable anchor links.
   - The **Products** or **Our Cookies** section (which should showcase different Crumb Haven cookies) is missing or hidden. Ensure it is visible, styled, and responsive.
   - Check for `display: none`, broken anchor tags, or missing imports that could be hiding these.

3. ‚úÖ **Navigation Links:**
   - Ensure navigation links (e.g., Home, About, Testimonials, Products) correctly scroll to or jump to the appropriate section using anchor tags (like `#testimonials`, `#products`).
   - Fix any broken nav links or misaligned sections.

4. ‚úÖ **Clean Up HTML:**
   - Remove any unused `<div>` blocks, commented-out duplicate code, or placeholder content.
   - Use semantic tags where possible (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to improve code clarity and SEO.

5. ‚úÖ **Ensure Responsive Design:**
   - Without changing the overall layout, verify that all sections (especially the Testimonials and Product cards) are **visible and functional on mobile**, tablet, and desktop views.
   - Fix any overlapping text or images caused by missing media queries or fixed widths.

6. ‚úÖ **Performance & SEO Basics:**
   - Minify repeated inline styles or large blocks of JS if possible.
   - Ensure all `<img>` tags have `alt` attributes and optimize lazy loading where applicable.
   - Clean up unused CSS classes or libraries (e.g., if Bootstrap or Animate.css is included but not used).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not change:**
- Fonts
- Brand colors
- Images and videos
- Logo and favicon
- Page order

üì¶ You may assume all assets (images, JS, CSS) are already present in the Replit `public` or `assets` folder.

üí° Deliver clean and production-ready HTML/CSS/JS code that matches the current design but fixes the technical issues and duplication mentioned above.
