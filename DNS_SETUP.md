# DNS Configuration for Crumb Haven Website

This guide explains how to configure DNS records for the crumbhaven.in domain to work with Netlify.

## DNS Configuration Options

You have two main options for configuring your DNS for use with Netlify:

### Option 1: Using Netlify DNS (Recommended)

Netlify can manage your DNS entirely, which simplifies setup and enables features like Netlify's CDN, automatic SSL, and domain redirects.

#### Steps to Transfer DNS to Netlify:

1. In your Netlify site dashboard, go to Domain settings â†’ Add custom domain
2. Enter "crumbhaven.in" and click "Verify"
3. Select "Set up Netlify DNS for your domain"
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions:
   - Netlify will provide a list of nameservers (typically 4)
   - Log in to your domain registrar (where you purchased crumbhaven.in)
   - Find the DNS or nameserver settings
   - Replace the current nameservers with Netlify's nameservers
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

#### Netlify Nameservers:
```
dns1.p05.nsone.net
dns2.p05.nsone.net
dns3.p05.nsone.net
dns4.p05.nsone.net
```

### Option 2: Using Your Current DNS Provider

If you prefer to keep using your current DNS provider, you'll need to add specific DNS records to point to Netlify.

#### Required DNS Records:

| Record Type | Name/Host | Value/Target | TTL |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| A           | @         | 75.2.60.5    | Auto/3600 |
| CNAME       | www       | [your-site-name].netlify.app | Auto/3600 |

#### Steps to Add These Records:

1. Log in to your domain registrar's control panel
2. Find the DNS management section
3. Add the A record pointing the root domain to Netlify's IP
4. Add the CNAME record pointing "www" to your Netlify subdomain
5. Save changes
6. Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

## Verifying DNS Configuration

To check if your DNS is correctly configured:

1. Use a DNS lookup tool like [MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) or [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/)
2. Enter your domain (crumbhaven.in) and check the A and CNAME records
3. Confirm that they match the expected values

## Troubleshooting DNS Issues

### Common DNS Problems and Solutions:

1. **DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN Error**
   - This means the domain cannot be found in the DNS system
   - Solution: Verify DNS records are correct and wait for propagation

2. **Site Not Showing as Secure**
   - Netlify might still be provisioning your SSL certificate
   - Solution: Wait up to 24 hours for SSL provisioning

3. **Only Works with/without www**
   - Solution: Ensure both A record (for root) and CNAME (for www) are configured

4. **Domain Shows Netlify Default Page**
   - Solution: Verify your site is correctly deployed on Netlify

## Additional DNS Records You Might Want

### Email Configuration:

If you plan to use email with your domain, add these records:

| Record Type | Name/Host | Value/Target | TTL |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| MX          | @         | (Your email provider's MX record) | Auto/3600 |
| TXT         | @         | (SPF record - ask your email provider) | Auto/3600 |
| CNAME       | mail      | (Your email provider's value) | Auto/3600 |

### Google Search Console Verification:

| Record Type | Name/Host | Value/Target | TTL |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| TXT         | @         | (Google-provided verification string) | Auto/3600 |
